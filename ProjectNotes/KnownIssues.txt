BUG: New add button for searching tracks is appearing in queue display (host activity).  Will probably be displayed in client activity too.

Enhancement: Sure there is a better way to remove add icon (search tracks) than refreshing entire data set.

BUG: Playlist will end if track finishes (organically) and MetaData has not been updated.
